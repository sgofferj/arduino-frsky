Public functions:

char update(char c);
  Function:   Send a char to the decoder, if a full packet has been received,
              updates internal values
  Parameters: 1 char, read from serial port
  Returns:    1 if complete packet was received, 0 if no copmplete packet was
              received

unsigned char getRX_a1();
  Function:   Get raw value of receiver A1 port
  Parameters: None
  Returns:    Raw value of receiver A1 port (0-255)
  Note:       The internal voltage sensor has a 4:1 divider, leading to a
              result of 0-13,2V in 256 steps. To get the voltage, multiply with
              0,0517647058824

unsigned char getRX_a2();
  Function:   Get raw value of receiver A2 port
  Parameters: None
  Returns:    Raw value of receiver A2 port (0-255)
  Note:       Without divider, the result represents 3,3V in 256 steps. To get
              the voltage, multiply with 0.0129411764706

unsigned char getLink_up();
  Function:   Get TX RSSI value
  Parameters: None
  Returns:    RSSI value for TX (how strong does the receiver receive the
              transmitter signal)

unsigned char getLink_dn();
  Function:   Get RX RSSI value
  Parameters: None
  Returns:    2*RSSI value for RX (how strong does the transmitter module
              receive the telemetry signal)
  Note:       The value is doubled. To get the correct value, divide by 2.
